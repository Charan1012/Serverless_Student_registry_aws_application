Serverless Student Registry Application
--------------------------------------------
This project implements a serverless architecture to manage student records using AWS S3, API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB. 
The application allows users to add and retrieve student data such as Student ID, Name, Class, and Age through POST and GET requests.

Project Architecture
-----------------------
Frontend (HTML & JavaScript)
-----------------------------
The HTML file provides a user-friendly interface for submitting student information.
The JavaScript file handles the POST requests to add student data and GET requests to retrieve records, using the API Gateway endpoint.
The API endpoint, generated by API Gateway, is integrated within the JavaScript code, allowing communication between the frontend and AWS services.

Backend (AWS Services)
----------------------
Amazon S3: Hosts the static website, serving the HTML and JavaScript files.
API Gateway: Routes API requests from the frontend to the backend Lambda functions.
POST: Adds new student records.
GET: Retrieves existing student data.
AWS Lambda: Handles the serverless execution for both POST and GET requests.
POST requests store student details in DynamoDB.
GET requests fetch student records from DynamoDB.
DynamoDB: Stores student records, ensuring scalable data storage and fast retrieval.
Proof of Project
As AWS services cannot be uploaded, screenshots of the project have been added to the repository as proof of work:

UI Screenshots: Showcasing the user interface where student details are submitted.
Backend Execution: Screenshots showing the interaction between API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB.
